## Functions used in Tip calculator
```{r,echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
CalcTip <- function(TotalPmt,TipPercent) {
    TotalPmt*TipPercent/100
}
CalcTotal <- function(TotalPmt,TipPercent) {
    TotalPmt*(1+TipPercent/100)
}
CalcPerPerson <- function(TotalPmt,TipPercent,NumPPL) {
    TotalPmt*(1+TipPercent/100)/NumPPL
}
# Simple Example
c(CalcTip(100,5),CalcTotal(100,5),CalcPerPerson(100,5,3))
```
